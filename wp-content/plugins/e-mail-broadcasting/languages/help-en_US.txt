<strong>What is the <em>triggerhash</em>, and what is the point of it?</strong>
Trigger hash, is a secret keystring that allow triggering the session sending from web without be logged as admin and allowing every user to trigger the session.
Some hosting accounts provide an webcrontab, which is a useful tool and allow you to open url in timed. For example we will set triggerhash to <strong><em>"testhash123"</em></strong>
and we set the webcrontab to open every hour the url <strong><u>http://{your blog url}/?e-mail-broadcasting-trigger=testhash123</u></strong>
This will automatically send the potions in the quee (in case that we have a lot of email subscribers)

<strong>Triggerhash functionality can be disabled simple with set the field blank</strong>
